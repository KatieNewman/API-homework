Using an API key to access information on OpenWeatherMap.org, data for more than 500 cities was pulled and analyzed to show how weather changes as you approach Earth's equator. The latitude for each city was compared across four measures: Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed. 

# Findings

There is a relatively strong correlation bewteen latitude and temperature. Temperatures are higher the closer one is to the Equator (0 degrees Latitude), as shown below.

There is little correlation between humidity and latitude.

There is almost no correlation between cloudiness and latitude.

The correlation between latitude and wind speed is very weak.

Please Note: Although a random sampling of cities across the globe was used, results show a slight bias to cities in the Northern Hemisphere.
