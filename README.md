Using OpenWeatherMapAPI, data for more than 500 cities was pulled and analyzed to show how weather changes as you approach Earth's equator. The latitude for each city was compared across four measures: Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed. 

Findings:
There is a relatively strong correlation bewteen latitude and temperature.
There is little correlation between humidity and latitude.
There is almost no correlation between cloudiness and latitude.
The correlation between latitude and wind speed is very weak.
Although I used a random sample of cities across the globe, my results show a slight bias to cities in the Northern Hemisphere.
